This file contains internal agreements about way of working for cep-mediation. It is updated in ad-hoc manner.

1. Code conventions

Code should be formatted with Ericsson_CodeTemplate_Modified_For_Cep.xml. Modifications to offical eniq events format are:
-line length is 160 instead of 120
-final modifier is not added automatically

To import the formatting file go to Window>Preferences then Java>CodeStyle>Formatter. Click Import and select the file.

Also we try to follow official oracle code convetions as described in codeconventions-150003.pdf.

Comments like the one below should be avoided:

    /**
     * @return the fileServerData
     */
    public FileServerData getFileServerData() {
        return fileServerData;
    }

    /**
     * @param fileServerData the fileServerData to set
     */
    public void setFileServerData(FileServerData fileServerData) {
        this.fileServerData = fileServerData;
    }

Also avoid one line methods as these make code fragmented and more difficult to read.

2. Junit

Unit tests for all classes should be implemented. 

Currently there are two common design problems in our code base related to unit testing:

-some methods are declared public instead of private so that they can be invoked from test classes

-setters/getters are defined for some private fields so that their value can be mocked in test classes

To avoid these probs(as it is ruining the design of our system) two classes have been created:                                                                                                
PrivateFieldAccessor.java and PrivateMethodCaller.java

3. Commiting

A) Both JIRA number AND text description should be in the commit msg
B) After commit check that Jenkins build is passing and there are no test failures
C) Submit for code review

4. Pull with rebase

This is prefered over the pure pull to keep history flat. Here is a command line way of doing it
git pull --rebase
 
If git complains about uncommited changes and I do not want to commit them:
git stash
 
Now rebase succeeds:
git pull --rebase
 
Fix conflicts if there are such and do:
 git add <file_with_conflict_resolved>
 
Then finish the rebase:
git rebase --continue
 
Re-apply the stashed changes and resolve conflicts if there are such:
git stash apply
